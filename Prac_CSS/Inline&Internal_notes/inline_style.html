            Oh, you got power, superpowers
            Do you even know how to wield them?
            All God's children are special
            But not like you, no, not like you

            You're just like a flower (flower)
            You're ever-giving, that's a given
            All God's children (all God's children) are special (whoa)
            But not like you, no, not like you

            Lift your head to the sky (to the sky, oh, sky, sky)
            (Lift it, lift it, lift it, lift it)

            Mm, it's crazy to say this
            But you're the greatest (you are the greatest)
            I can't explain it (oh)
            I know that you know the truth
            They can't deny you, yeah
            They can't deny you, it's true

            Yeah, remember Vegas?
            You come a long way, kid
            And let me just say this
            Oh, yeah, you're the main character now
            You're the main character now
